# TeamFortressKeyPrice

The marketplace on steam is somehow a marvelous place. People get to buy and sell items fo their favorite games and sometimes make a change to spend on steam sales.

One item is of particular relevance: "Mann Co. Supply Crate Key", or how I like to call it, the Team Fortress Key, an item which is commonly used as currency for
transactions that require a large amount of funds, sometimes way past the $2,000.00 allowed per account on steam (Who buys and sells those kind of items?).

Knowing that, I decided to develop a small application to find out how the price of this such item behaves.

If you got here, it's a permanent "working in progress" kind of project, so fell free to take a look and make suggestions on how to improve it.

Hope you enjoy it.
